										<h3>Captain Jamie</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Captain Jamie grew up on the shores of South Africa. His parents being avid SCUBA divers, he was taught from an early
										age to understand the ocean and all that goes on above and below its surface, to protect it, to love it and most of all,
										to respect it. Growing up the Indian Ocean was his natural playground and at a young age he was already an accomplished surfer,
										free diver and spearfisherman he became a qualified SCUBA diver at the age of 12 and spent much of his free time in his early
										teens racing 30ft monohulls up and down the coast. The ocean became a way of life and from a young age Jamie knew the sea would 
										forever be his home. He began his professional life as a SCUBA instructor at the age of 18, working for a company specializing 
										in the conservation and research of aquatic life. He then used his natural affinity to share his love and knowledge of the 
										underwater world to travel the eastern coast of Africa from the vast shores of south Africa, up through Mozambique, into 
										Tanzania and Zanzibar. All the while honing his skills captaining dive boats and sailing yachts in some of the most challenging
										environments on earth. 
									</p>
									<p>
										His adventures ultimately landed him in the British Virgin Islands in 2013, working initially for shore 
										based companies; he ran SCUBA diving excursions throughout the BVI as well as working for a commercial diving operation 
										specializing in yacht maintenance, repair and salvage. No longer able to be confined to land he joined a dive liveaboard as a 
										dive instructor but his knowledge and natural ability saw him promoted through the ranks of engineer and up to Captain of the 
										105ft vessel all in the space of a year. Mentored by a true legend in the BVI charter industry Jamie was gifted with knowledge 
										of the area that took his employer forty years to accumulate, combined with years of experience in the area, you can safely say
										Jamie is an expert on the area and can truly show you Natures Little Secrets.

										<h3>Chef Susannah</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Chef Susannah hails from Northern Ireland but is no stranger to the water, with her family being very active members of the Royal
										Yacht Club, she was taught to sail on Lasers from a young age in waters where the consequences of a mistake could mean a dunk in
										the Atlantics dangerously could waters. She was also taught to handle the large rescue Ribs and was present on many safety and 
										rescue operations coordinated by her father. Her thirst for adventure soon had her travelling the world, visiting countries such
										as Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Thailand, Vietnam and the list goes on. Her travels and her outgoing nature has allowed her to
										immerse herself in a variety of cultures which ignited her passion for people and of course food. Drawn to the water she was soon
										a qualified diver and keen surfer. Her travels brought her to the BVI in 2015 and she fell in love with the Caribbean way of life.
										The beauty of the Virgin Islands combined with the endless possibilities for adventure and exploration both above and below the 
										water meant she knew she had found a place she could call home. After many months working as a stewardess Susannah found the galley
										calling her name and so her professional culinary journey began. Not one to do things halfheartedly Susannah went on to complete not
										one but two professional chef courses. Under the guidance of many excellent teachers at Ashburtons Chef Academy (Devon, England) she
										completed the level 2 course in culinary skills and food safety in catering. Just a few months later motivated and ready to learn 
										more she attended the prestigious Ballymaloe cookery school (Co.Cork Ireland) and graduated from their intensive 3 month course. 
										Susannah's cooking reflects seasonal local produce and contemporary plating whilst always considering guests preferences. 
									</p>

								<section>
									<p>
										Having sailed over two thousand miles together, in the last two years, throughout the Caribbean, Jamie and Susannah are excited to 
										embark on their next adventure, Island Hoppin'. Trading bigger yachts and larger numbers for the luxury, comfort and performance 
										of a new Lagoon 52. They cannot wait to show their guests the beauty of the Virgin Islands and share their love for the water and 
										all the amazing activities available. Why not come Island Hoppin' with a crew that's made for it and a vessel named for it!
