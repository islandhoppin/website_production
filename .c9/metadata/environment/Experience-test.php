the boat. They were friendly and professional all the while getting us quickly onbaord after snapping the first of many pictures for us. They looked sharp as did Island Hoppin'. We were shown to our cabin and told to settle a bit and come up for safety information before we set off. Everything was done to make us feel us welcomed. It was a perfect beginning to a wonderful week long charter.","","The crew went out of their way to find extra large size 14 fins for one guest. They also gave instruction and encouragement on the use of all equipment.","","The boat was very comfortable and we loved all the spaces to sun, read, dine or watch Jamie raise the sails. We're sailors so it was fascinating to view all the high tech equipment used for navigation and operating the sails. We had expressed a desire to sail as much as possible and Jamie was as happy as we were to watch the sails fill and the boat respond . There is nothing like the sounds and sights of sailing.","","Jamie was the perfect combination of professional captain and fun ship mate. We felt like friends all enjoying the same adventure. When time came for getting underway both Susannah and Jamie worked to secure the boat, pull the anchor and set the sails. They did all this easily and without any confusion. They made it look easy . They are fit, capable and knowledgeable.","","Jamie not only answered every sailing question he gave the guys a tour of the engine room too. They were fascinated by all the operating systems and Jamie gave them a great \"tour.\" I have some funny pictures of Jamie standing in the opening and the men looking down into the compartment.","","We were pleased that our preferences were taken into consideration. Susannah prepared fresh fruit for our breakfast that was sweet and arranged on tray. There was always plenty served and the quality was outstanding. Crisp greens were used for our lunch salads and the dressings were all homemade. Susannah uses ingredients to create some of the best salads we've ever enjoyed. We encoured Sue to write up her recipes so we could attempt to recreate them. We had fish served with salsa's and sauces that were tasty and attractive. Jamie grilled delicious, tender chicken and beef which Susannah served up with roasted vegetables. Each dinner was served by Jamie who would explain what Susannah had created. When we had questions on ingredients Susannah would come out and give us the details on how she'd created our meal. I can't say enough about the quality of our meals. The desserts were amazing. Susannah surprised us with delicous desserts too. Each dinner ended with a sweet indulgence. I think my favorite was the Lemon Souffle served with raspberries. Chocolate brownie with a side of ice cream was Bill's favortie. All desserts were beautifully served too. The attention to detail of each meal served was outstanding. Susannah is an outstanding and competent chef, The food exceeded our expectations.
